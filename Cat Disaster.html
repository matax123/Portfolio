            <p class="centro">Cat Disaster was a project built to win a competition that was
                presented to me and a group of friends inside the university we are studying in
                when we were at the third semester of the degree.
            <br>The competition was about making the best videogame in unity among all of the
                teams that were going to take part.
            <br>We can say the project was succesfull as we won the first place.

                <p class="centro">Additionally to the play window, there were other windows like 
                    "Options" that lets you deactivate sounds or reset your game:</p>
